# Adobe Express
Proof of Concept for the Adobe Express Project

1. .\blender.exe -b -P "path\to\script" -- "path\to\3d input" "path\to\save\blender file" "path\to\2d output"

2. Use a content delivery service to host the 2d output 

3. Use Adobe Express's developer coding playground to refer to cdn or just simply drag and drop the 2d image into Adobe Express
